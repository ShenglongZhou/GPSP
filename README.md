# GPSP
This Matlab package solves the one-bit compressed sensing.

It was created based on the algorithm proposed by 

"Zhou S., Luo Z. and Xiu N., [Computing One-bit Compressive Sensing via Double-Sparsity Constrained Optimization](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348371863), [*arXiv:2101.03599*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03599), 2021".

Please give credits to this paper if you use the code for your research.
