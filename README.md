# GPSP
This Matlab package solves the one-bit compressed sensing.

It was created based on the algorithm proposed by 

"Zhou S., Luo Z. and Xiu N., Computing One-bit Compressive Sensing via Double-Sparsity Constrained Optimization, 2021".

Please give credits to this paper if you use the code for your research.
